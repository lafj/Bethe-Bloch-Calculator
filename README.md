This program is a graphical user interface "calculator" which  
calculates and plots the energy loss and range of heavy charged  
particles going through matter.  
The program reads two files containing material- and particle  
parameters. The user can choose what kind of particle and   
what material the particle should traverse. The user then defines  
the energy of the incoming particle. Press 'Calculate and Draw' and the  
program calculates the energy loss, the range and draws the plots.
